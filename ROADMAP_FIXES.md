# Verify different options show based on business type
```

### **Step 2: Verify Database Integration** 🔄 **READY NOW**

```sql
-- Check business types in database
SELECT * FROM business_type_configs;

FROM businesses b
JOIN business_staff bs ON b.id = bs.business_id
WHERE bs.user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### **Step 3: Test Permission System** 🔄 **READY NOW**
