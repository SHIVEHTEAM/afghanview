# Security Checklist

## âœ… Completed Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- [x] API routes require authentication
- [x] Role-based access control implemented
- [x] Restaurant owners can only access their own data
- [x] Admin routes protected
- [x] Protected route component implemented

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- [x] Input validation utilities created
- [x] String sanitization implemented
- [x] Object sanitization implemented
- [x] Required field validation

### Security Headers

- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Permissions-Policy configured

### Rate Limiting

- [x] Rate limiting implemented for API routes
- [x] 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- [x] Rate limit headers included

### Error Handling

- [x] Debug logs removed from production code
- [x] Generic error messages (no sensitive data exposed)
- [x] Proper error status codes

### Environment Security

- [x] Hardcoded secrets removed
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] Service role keys not exposed to client

## ðŸ”„ Ongoing Security Measures

### Monitoring & Logging

- [ ] Set up security monitoring
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity

### Data Protection

- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest
- [ ] Set up backup encryption
- [ ] Implement data retention policies

### Infrastructure Security

- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication Bypass** - All API routes now require authentication
2. **Data Exposure** - Restaurant owners can only access their own data
3. **Debug Information Leakage** - Removed all console.log statements
4. **Hardcoded Secrets** - Removed hardcoded Supabase URL
5. **Missing Security Headers** - Added comprehensive security headers
6. **No Rate Limiting** - Implemented rate limiting for API routes
7. **Input Validation** - Added input validation and sanitization

## ðŸ“‹ Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Set up proper environment variables
- [ ] Configure Supabase RLS policies
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure backup and recovery
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules

### After Deployment

- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify role-based access control
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Verify security headers
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Monitor for security issues

## ðŸ”§ Security Tools to Consider

- [ ] OWASP ZAP for security testing
- [ ] Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] SonarQube for code quality and security
- [ ] Cloudflare for DDoS protection
- [ ] Sentry for error monitoring
