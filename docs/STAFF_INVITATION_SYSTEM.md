# Staff Invitation System - Complete Implementation

This document describes the fully functional staff invitation system implemented in ShivehView.

## Overview

The staff invitation system allows business owners and managers to invite new staff members to their business. The system includes:

- **Email-based invitations** with secure tokens
- **Invitation acceptance pages** with user-friendly UI
- **Role-based permissions** (owner, manager, staff)
- **Automatic expiration** after 7 days
- **Email templates** ready for production use

## How It Works

### 1. Invitation Process

1. **Business owner/manager** goes to `/client/staff`
2. **Clicks "Invite Staff"** and enters email + role
3. **System creates invitation** in `staff_invitations` table
4. **Email is sent** to the invited person (currently logged to console)
5. **Invitation appears** in pending invitations list

### 2. Acceptance Process

1. **Invited person receives email** with invitation link
2. **Clicks link** to go to `/invitation/accept?token=...`
3. **Page validates token** and shows invitation details
4. **User signs in/signs up** if not already authenticated
5. **Clicks "Accept Invitation"** to join the business
6. **System creates staff record** and updates invitation status
7. **User is redirected** to client dashboard

## Database Schema

### staff_invitations Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.staff_invitations (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  business_id uuid NOT NULL,
  email text NOT NULL,
  role text NOT NULL CHECK (role = ANY (ARRAY['owner'::text, 'manager'::text, 'staff'::text])),
  invited_by uuid NOT NULL,
  status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'::text CHECK (status = ANY (ARRAY['pending'::text, 'accepted'::text, 'expired'::text, 'declined'::text])),
  invited_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
  accepted_at timestamp with time zone,
  accepted_by uuid,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),

  CONSTRAINT staff_invitations_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT staff_invitations_business_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (business_id) REFERENCES public.businesses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT staff_invitations_invited_by_fkey FOREIGN KEY (invited_by) REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  CONSTRAINT staff_invitations_accepted_by_fkey FOREIGN KEY (accepted_by) REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  CONSTRAINT staff_invitations_business_email_unique UNIQUE (business_id, email)
);
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/business/staff/invite

Creates a new staff invitation and sends email.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "staff@example.com",
  "role": "staff",
  "business_id": "uuid"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "invitation": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "staff@example.com",
    "role": "staff",
    "status": "pending",
    "invited_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2024-01-08T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "emailSent": true
}
```

### POST /api/business/staff/accept

Accepts a staff invitation using a token.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "token": "base64-encoded-token"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "You have successfully joined Business Name as staff",
  "business": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Business Name"
  },
  "role": "staff"
}
```

## Frontend Pages

### /client/staff

Staff management page where owners/managers can:

- View current staff members
- Invite new staff members
- Manage pending invitations
- Update staff roles
- Remove staff members

### /invitation/accept

Invitation acceptance page where invited users can:

- View invitation details
- Sign in or sign up if needed
- Accept the invitation
- See success confirmation

## Email System

### Current Implementation

The email system currently logs invitation details to the console. To enable actual email sending:

1. **Install email service** (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
2. **Add API key** to environment variables
3. **Uncomment email code** in `lib/email.ts`

### Email Templates

Ready-to-use HTML and text email templates are available in `lib/email-templates.ts`:

- **Professional design** with ShivehView branding
- **Responsive layout** for mobile devices
- **Clear call-to-action** buttons
- **Fallback text version** for email clients

### Example Email Integration

```typescript
// In lib/email.ts, replace the console.log with:
const sgMail = require("@sendgrid/mail");
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
await sgMail.send({
  to: email,
  from: "noreply@shivehview.com",
  subject: `You're invited to join ${data.businessName} on ShivehView`,
  html: htmlContent,
  text: textContent,
});
```

## Security Features

### Token System

- **Base64 encoded tokens** containing invitation ID and timestamp
- **Automatic validation** of token format and content
- **Single-use tokens** (invitation status updated after acceptance)

### Permission Checks

- **Only owners/managers** can send invitations
- **Email verification** ensures invitations go to correct users
- **Business ownership validation** prevents unauthorized access
- **Role-based restrictions** limit manager permissions

### Expiration System

- **7-day expiration** for all invitations
- **Automatic status updates** for expired invitations
- **Database triggers** to handle expiration

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Site URL for invitation links
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Email service API key (when implementing real email)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

## Testing the System

### 1. Send Invitation

1. Go to `/client/staff`
2. Click "Invite Staff"
3. Enter email and select role
4. Click "Send Invitation"
5. Check console for email log

### 2. Accept Invitation

1. Copy the invitation URL from console log
2. Open in new browser/incognito window
3. Sign in with the invited email
4. Click "Accept Invitation"
5. Verify staff member appears in list

### 3. Test Expiration

1. Create invitation
2. Wait for expiration (or manually update database)
3. Try to accept expired invitation
4. Verify error message

## Production Deployment

### Email Service Setup

1. **Choose email provider** (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES, etc.)
2. **Configure domain** for sending emails
3. **Add API key** to environment variables
4. **Update email code** in `lib/email.ts`
5. **Test email delivery** in staging environment

### Security Considerations

1. **Rate limiting** on invitation endpoints
2. **Email validation** to prevent spam
3. **Domain verification** for business emails
4. **Audit logging** for invitation activities
5. **CSRF protection** on acceptance endpoints

### Monitoring

1. **Email delivery rates** and bounces
2. **Invitation acceptance rates**
3. **Failed invitation attempts**
4. **System performance** under load

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invitation not found**: Check token format and database
2. **Email not sent**: Verify email service configuration
3. **Permission denied**: Check user roles and business ownership
4. **Expired invitation**: Create new invitation or extend expiration

### Debug Steps

1. **Check console logs** for email details
2. **Verify database records** in staff_invitations table
3. **Test token validation** with sample tokens
4. **Check environment variables** are set correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk invitations** for multiple staff members
2. **Invitation templates** for different business types
3. **Advanced permissions** with granular controls
4. **Invitation analytics** and reporting
5. **Mobile app support** for invitations
6. **Integration with HR systems**
